    <p>A thing that players all love about Minecraft is the creative mode. In creative mode you have an inventory filled with every block in minecraft. A player can build anything with their imagination. Many players across the world have made giant creations from their favorite movie character or maybe even their own imagination. Many players world wide usually team up and make great buildings. I also am one of the many players that ejoy playying in creative mode since you can build whatever you want. </p>

    <p>The most common thing that people will do in creative mode is pixel art. Its the easiest type of art that you can do in minecraft since you have the variety of blocks in your hand. I have also tried pixel art but it takes time and patience to make what you want. My friends and I usually get together sometimes and start making anything. If you go on youtube there are usually building videos of giant creations. Many of them are unbelivable. There are lets plays where youtubers play on servers by them selves or with their other youtuber friends. The most famous Minecraft player on youtube is SkydoesMinecraft. Like many other minecraft youtubers their fame came from playing minecraft and/or building.</p>
