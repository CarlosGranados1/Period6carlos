    <h1>Famous MOBS in Minecraft</h1>
    <p>In Minecraft you will encounter MOBS. MOBS a basically creatures in the game. There are two types of MOBS in the game, there are hostile MOBS and there are peaceful MOBS. Hostlie MOBS are mostly monsters in the game. Hostile mobs include the creeper, zombie, and skeleton (etc.). Peacful MOBS include just animals in the game and villagers.</p>

    <p>In the picture above you can see just some of the MOBS in Minecraft. The most common hostile MOB or monster that people will think of is the creeper since the company mojang (the game develepers) sometimes uses the creeper as their logo for T-shirts, but enough of the creeper I should start talking about other MOBS. A rare MOB in the game that rarley come up is the spider jockey. It is a skeleton on top of a spider. Personally i think its a funny yet deadly combination. Another thing that is funny but not deadly is the chicken jockey. It is a baby zombie riding a chicken</p>
