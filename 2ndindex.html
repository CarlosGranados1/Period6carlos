    <h1>Famous MOBS in Minecraft</h1>
    <p>In Minecraft you will encounter MOBS. MOBS a basically creatures in the game. There are two types of MOBS in the game, there are hostile MOBS and there are peaceful MOBS. Hostlie MOBS are mostly monsters in the game. Hostile mobs include the creeper, zombie, and skeleton (etc.). Peacful MOBS include just animals in the game and villagers.</p>

    <p>In the picture above you can see just some of the MOBS in Minecraft. The most common hostile MOB or monster that people will think of is the creeper since the company mojang (the game develepers) sometimes uses the creeper as their logo for T-shirts, but enough of the creeper I should start talking about other MOBS. A rare MOB in the game that rarley come up is the spider jockey. It is a skeleton on top of a spider. Personally i think its a funny yet deadly combination. Another thing that is funny but not deadly is the chicken jockey. It is a baby zombie riding a chicken. Every time I encounter a chicken jockey I laugh.</p>

    <p>Another MOB that I woild like to talk about is the villager. Villagers are peacefull MOBS but  if they get bitten by a zombie they will turn into zombie villagers. Another thing is that if a villager gets struck by lightning they will turn into a witch,but in this case it is rare. Next up are Ghasts. They are giant crying flying ghosts. For me i think theyre the most dangerous thing to keep an eye out for when your in the nether. Another MOB that lives in the nether is the zombie pigman. They are both a comination of a pig and a zombie. The worst thing is that they always carry a golden sword. Also if you didnt know what the nether is,it is an under world in Minecraft. Finally the last MOB I will talk about is the zombie. They are undead creatures that roam the land of minecraft. They are very deadly if they come in 3 or 4. The good thing is that they are not immune to sunlight.they will burn as soon as the sun comes up, the bad part is that if you get hit while they are on fire (yes fire!!) you will catch on fire as well. So might as well put them out quickly because you will burn if you dont. There are 3 types of zombies. There are the regular zombie, zombie villager, and the husk. The husk are the most interesting type of zombie because they live in the desert and dont burn in sunlight.</p>
