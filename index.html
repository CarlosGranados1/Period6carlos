<p>Minecraft is a sandbox game for creation and survival. A sandbox game is a game that lets the player roam in the game and create things. There are no limits to anyones creation(except the sky that is). Once you get into the game there are unlimited things that you can do once you're in the game(in creative). You can build anything you want if you put your mind to it.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things to do in Minecraft is to play on survival mode. In survival mode you begin with nothing and you have to survive monsters and hunger throughout the game. A monster that a player will usually face in survival will be the creeper. The creeper is a green monster that will blow up right behind your back and will leave you weak or dead. They get very annoying if you are mining something or building something.(FUN FACT)The creeper was made when the creator of mincraft messed up the code for the creeper. If only the creator/developer wrote clean code the creeper wouldnt be in the game to annoy players.</p>
